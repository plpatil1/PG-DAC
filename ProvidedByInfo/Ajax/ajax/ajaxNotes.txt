Ajax:
-Ajax is not a programming language.
-Ajax is technique for accessing web-server from a web-page.
-Ajax stand for Aynchronous javascript and XML.
-Ajax allows us to send and reveive data asynchronouly without reloading the web-page.
-becouse it work flow it is fast.

*where it is use.
-there are too many web applications running on the web  so that are on web-server using ajax like gmail,facebook,googlemap,youtube.

*Ajax just uses as combination javascript and XML 
- a browser built-in XMlHttRequest object (to make request to server for data from browser).
- to display Data we use javascript and HTML DOM

-with ajax we can update part of web application without reloading complete webpage.

Step to use Ajax in web-application 
step1: create object of XMlHttRequest
       let xmlObj = new XMlHttRequest();

step2: write callback method to handle response.
         xmlObj.onload = function (){
            handle response
         }
step3: create request by using open method.
        xmlObj.open("request","server-url");

step4: send request to server 
       xmlObj.send();


*install json-serer 
npm install -g json-server 

to ru json-file on json servr 
json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json 

*Jsondata :
-when we fetch data form web-server in comes in json.
-in json data is of type text or string. 
-it will look like javascrpt object.
-to perform manipulation with json data is not possbile so we -convert json-data into javascript object=> JSON.parse();
-convert javascript object into json=> JSON.stringify();

*CRUD
C-(create)- post request 
R-(Read)- get request 
U-(Update)- put request 
D-(Delete)- delete request 

*Task: create array of object for Employee having name,post,salary,location,mode and perform CRUD operation by Using Ajax , amake application good looking and responsive.
