Javascript: 
-it is use to add functionality into webapp.
-it is loosly typed language.
-it inter preted language.

*there are two ways to use Javascript
1.internal Javascript: in html file we use script tag in that we wrire js code.
2.external Javascript in this we creatw a sepreate js file and import it in html file by using script tag.

*how to get or display output in javascript.
1.document.write(): it will display output on browser. it will display output same line.
2.window.alert(): in will generare popup window and display output in it.
3.console.log():it will display output in browser console or in terminal.
4.innerHTML (DOM):it is use to insert data inside an element by using its id.

*Variable in javascript 
*in Javascript there are three ways to create variable 
var,let,const 

Q.why javascript is called as loosly typed. 
Q.what is hoisting.
-it is default javascript behaviour which moves variable declaration at top. this we can use variable first and then declare it.

Q.differance between var let and const.

var : it create function scope variable.
     -we can use variable before declaration of it.
     -we can redeclare variable

let : it create block scrope variable.
    -we can not use variable before declaration of it.
    -we can not redeclare variable.

const : it values will never change at run time.
       -when we declare we have initiLIZE AT SAME TIME.   


2009(ES5 ECMA5), 2015(ES6)

*function in javascript
-it is block of code which is use to perform perticular tas.
-function will execute only when we call it.
-function can reuse multiple time.

*array:
-it is use to store multiple values with same data type.
-in array data store on index basis.
-array index always from zero index.
-it is denoted by [];
*array method

*object : 
-it is use to store multiple with different data types.
-in object data store in key and value paire formate.
-we can access object data outside by writting object.keyname.
-object data represent {}.

*array of object 

*string and its mathod
string: 
-it is collection of character.
-in string every letter and space has index number.
-string index start from zero .
-we can write string in "" or '' .

*there three methode which will index of searching string. 
1.indexOf(searchingString,startIndex):
-it will seach string from left to right and return index of first occurences of  searching string.
-it takes two parameter 1.searchingString,2.startIndex.
-if searching string do found then it will return -1 value.

2.lastIndxOf(searchingString,startIndex):
-it will seach string from right to left and return index of first occurence of  searching string.
-it takes two parameter 1.searchingString,2.startIndex.
-if searching string do found then it will return -1 value.

3.search(searchingString):
-it will seach string from left to right and return index of first occurence of searching string.
-it takes one parameter 1.searchingString.
-if searching string do found then it will return -1 value.
-it is fater than indexOf method.

*there are three method which will retun part of string from large string
4.slice(startIndex,endIndex):
-it will return part of string.
-it will search string from left to right when you pass +ve index.
-it will search string from right to left when you pass -ve index.

5.subString(startIndex,endIndex):
-it will return part of string.
-it will search string from left to right it will accept only you pass +ve index.

6.subStr(startIndex,total-numner-of-character):
-it will return part of string.
-it will search string from left to right it will accept only you pass +ve index.

*Date and Time :
-in js if you want to get date and time for this first we have to create object of datae class.
-data class object return data and time form browser.
sytax: how tocreate object of date class.
      let objname = new Date();

sun=0
mon=1
fri=5
sat=6

jan=0,feb=1....dec=11
Task: get method by using date class object and display current month name.
Task: design and digital clock 

*how to set data and time 
 let objname = new Date(year,month,date,hours,minutes,second);


*What is call back functiuon.  
-pasing a function name as an argument inside another function is called callback function.

*setTimeout 
*setInterval 

*ES5 (ECMA5) -2009
1."use strict" : it is execute js code in stric mode.
                -it never allow to use variable before declaration of it.
                -it write at top of page.
2.trim(): 
it is use to remove unwanted white space from both side of string.    

*map,filter,every,some,reduce,reduceright 

*form validation: 
-to check wehter user enter data is correct or wrong
-there are two ways to perform form validation 
1. after submitting form data(onsubmit event) 
2. before submitting form data(onblure or onchage).

*external javascript
Task1: task is on replace methode as shown in image
task2: coply paste temprary address asme as permanant address when you click on button as shown in image
Task3: get method by using date class object and display current month name.
Task4: design and digital clock 
task5: password,contact,email,select course(droupdown),gender

*differance between == and  ===;
== : it compare and check values if it is same then it retun true result.
=== : it will compare and check values as well datatype of variable if both are same then and only then, it return true.
5==5
true
5=='5'
true
5===5
true
5==='5'
false

*how to hide and show imagees by using js.

*form validation beore submitting for data 
-onblure or onchange 



DOM(Document Object Model) manipulation 




*instalation of nodejs 
node -v 
npm -v   


*module : 
-it is javascript code orgnize in single or multiple js file we can reuse throughout application by exporting and importing.
-we can send data by using export keyword.
-we can access data by using import keyword.

*how to export function 
*how to export string literal 
*how to export class 


*BOM(Browser Object Model):
it is use to perform browser related operation for that we use it.
-to open new indow or tab 
-to navigate another location 
-use settimeout or setInterval 

object comes with BOM 
window,navigator,location,history

*Math function 
Math.abs(123.4)
123.4
Math.ceil(5.6)
6
Math.floor(5.6)
5
Math.round(5.5)
6
Math.round(5.4)
5
Math.random() : it will retun random number in between 0 and 1
